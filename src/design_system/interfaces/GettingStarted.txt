# Getting Started

Latitude Design System components are the building blocks of Flexport products. Component documentation is auto-generated from inline comments directly in the component sourcecode.

These components are shared across all product teams, but not all of them should be used for client-facing UI. Check the component stats for support before implementing in a client-facing feature. Some components use css-grid and certain flexbox styles that are not fully IE11 compliant.

## Component Info
Since these components are implemented by many teams with varying use-cases, component info is provided to expose insights that may be hard to determine from looking at a component's source. Each component includes a status that indicate it's stability; components tagged as "Beta" or "In Review" should be used with caution. "Stable" components have secure APIs, are design-approved, are well tested, and used extensively in our codebase.

## Component Examples
Most components contain a number of examples to illustrate common use-cases and demonstrate their capabilities. The examples contain code snippets to provide engineers quick access to copy and paste snippets.

## Component API
Component prop tables are generated from the component's props and will stay in sync when a component prop is changed. Inline comments with a prop will correspond to the prop description. The flow type, default value, and prop requirement will all be pulled from the component automatically âœ¨.
